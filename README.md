## CrazySonic

The awful source code to my awful ROM hack, CrazySonic. That's right, the "Polygon Jim award winning" hack from SHC2015, as featured on SomecallmeJohnny, MegaGWolf, and Vinesauce, that everyone loves and also hates, here for archival purposes. Feel free to take a look at the code, but beware, the code that I have written is from 2015, and is mostly spaghetti and not formatted consistently at all. I made this hack while I was still learning the ropes of programming for the Sega Genesis and working with 68000 assembly.

I did modify it a little. I slowed down the 420blazeit rainbow palette cycle and fixed a few bugs such as:
* Sanic having to do the CrazyBus special stage before entering the proper Sanic special stage
* Grayscale palette generator and rainbow palette cycle constantly overwriting each other when dying in 420blazeit mode
* GHZ music with broken sample IDs playing after the GHZ boss
* Rainbow palette cycle running in the pause menu

The Desert Bus game mode is still unfinished and most likely will remain that way. I have 0 interest in finishing whatever I had planned back in 2015 that didn't make it in time for SHC2015. Perhaps you can do it yourself if you really hated yourself ;)
